## Approaches to Multivariate Data

Two-step approach common in ecology:

1.  Reduce dimensionality with, e.g., PCA
2.  Include first 1--3 axes of co-variation in a regression

. . .

This answers the question...

> Do the variables that co-vary the most have an effect on the response?

. . .

... NOT...

> Which variables, if any, have an effect on the response?

## 

We've known there are problems with this approach for a long time!

> Mosteller and Tukey argue ... that the components with small variance are unlikely to be important in regression, apparently on the basis that nature is "tricky, but not downright mean".
> We shall see in the examples below that without too much effort we can find examples where nature *is* "downright mean".

## Supervised Methods

::: incremental
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   [Unsupervised]{.underline}: axes explain **variation** in the data
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](images/pca.png){fig-align="center" width="500"}
:::
:::

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   [Supervised]{.underline}: axes that explain the **relationship** with **response** variable
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Why are Supervised Methods Underused?

-   Lack of awareness / training

-   Familiarity with two-step method

-   Unconcerned with consequences ("nature isn't downright mean, right?")

::: notes
could possibly include results from mini-review here?

## Muffins vs. Cupcakes

To explain multivariate analyses and the consequences of unsupervised vs. supervised, I needed an intuitive example.

-   Scraped muffin and cupcake recipes from allrecipes.com

-   Extracted ingredients, standardized units, and removed frosting

-   269 recipes, 40 ingredients total

-   Sampled 30 recipes for analysis

## Ecological traits

-   Muir example from Oecologia paper

## Simulation Study

-   Point out how separation in PLS doesn't mean significance

-   Correction to that one paper

## Tea Metabolites

-   Figures from tea papers I've contributed to

-   Something about VIP scores and mention webchem

## Plantago

-   (needs better title)

-   figure from Colin's paper

## Project fishstats

-   Morphological measurements along the body

-   Collapse into 3 coefs for quadratic line

-   Use coefs in multivariate model

## BACE soil legacy thing

-   Highlight use of github pages for sharing report and figures.

## Other

-   Interest in reproducibility

-   Reprohacks

-   Getting labs set up using GitHub

-   GAMs?

-   population modeling?

-   Data quality assurance

-   R packages for data sharing and code stuff too
